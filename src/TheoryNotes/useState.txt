useState
  * Alwasy for safe side, in the useState hook, pass the function to update
  the value. Don't just update directly, but instead update it using
  function.
  e.g..: setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);

useState with Object
* const [name, updateName] = useState({firstName : '', lastName : ''})
* useState does not automatically merge the objet. In setState(class Component), the state in
  merged whereas in here we have to do it manually using the spread operator.
  e.g.., setName({...name, firstName : e.target.value})
  Reading the above is : copy every propety in the name object and then just override the
  firstName field with a different value.
