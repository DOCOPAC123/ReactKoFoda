                    *** Rules of Hooks ***

* Only call Hooks at the Top level
* Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions or nested functions.

* Only call Hooks from React functions
* Call them within React Functional components and not just any regular
  Javascript functions.


useState
  * Alwasy for safe side, in the useState hook, pass the function to update
  the value. Don't just update directly, but instead update it using
  function.
  e.g..: setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
